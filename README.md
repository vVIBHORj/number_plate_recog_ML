# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) 🚗🔍  

This project implements an **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system using Python, OpenCV, and Machine Learning techniques. The system processes vehicle images, detects number plates, and extracts text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).  

## 📌 Features  
- Preprocessing of vehicle images (grayscale, noise removal, thresholding).  
- Detection of license plate regions using OpenCV.  
- Character segmentation and extraction.  
- Text recognition using **Tesseract OCR**.  
- End-to-end pipeline for Number Plate Recognition.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV** – image processing and contour detection.  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations.  
- **Matplotlib** – visualization.  
- **Pytesseract** – Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
